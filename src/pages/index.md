# Chialisp

A LISP-like language for encumbering and releasing funds with smart-contract capabilities. Documentation is very new and some components are still rapidly changing, but this is a consolidated place to learn about Chialisp and clvm.

## Coloured coins

The first Chialisp smart transaction that we integrated into chia-blockchain were Coloured Coins. We will be integrating additional smart transactions and wallets into chia-blockchain in most releases.
